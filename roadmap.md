# Learning Roadmap & Deadlines

## Courses
1. IBM: AI for Everyone: Master the Basics - https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/ibm-ai-for-everyone-master-the-basics

2. Google AI for Anyone -https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/google-google-ai-for-anyone

3. ArmEducationX: Introduction to AI - https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/arm-education-introduction-to-ai

4. DelftX: AI Skills for Engineers: Data Engineering and Data Pipelines - https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/delft-university-of-technology-ai-skills-for-engineers-data-engineering-and-data-pipelines

Before you build ML models, you need data pipeline, cleaning, preparation skills.

5. DelftX: AI Skills for Engineers: Supervised Machine Learning - https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/delft-university-of-technology-ai-skills-for-engineers-supervised-machine-learning

After you know data pipelines ‚Üí apply algorithms. Learn classification/regression with scikit-learn. Build small projects.

6. HarvardX: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Professional Certificate - https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning

More in depth, covers Python usage & ML for data science workflows.

Good for building a portfolio: you can complete certificate and put projects/examples in your repo/docs.

7. CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python - https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python

8. Deep Learning Professional Certificate (IBM) - https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/ibm-deep-learning

Once you‚Äôve done ML and are comfortable ‚Üí move to DL. Neural networks, CNNs, perhaps Transformers.

9. Machine Learning Operations Professional Certificate - https://www.edx.org/es/certificates/professional-certificate/ai-machine-learning-operations

After you have models and code, you need to know how to deploy them, version them, containerize, track them. MLOps is key for real-world usage.

10. MLOps1 (Azure / GCP / AWS) - https://www.edx.org/learn/azure/statistics-com-mlops1-azure-deploying-ai-ml-models-in-production-using-microsoft-azure-machine-learning

Deploy your ML models ‚Üí good for portfolio / resume.

11. AI: Cloud Machine Learning Engineering and MLOps - https://www.edx.org/es/learn/machine-learning/pragmatic-ai-labs-cloud-machine-learning-engineering-and-mlops

For more holistic engineering practices: pipelines, production delivery, ML systems.
